# Wharton-Analytics-Challenge


Teach for America seeks to recruit remarkable leaders from a broad spectrum of universities. In

order to maximize our limited resources, we differentiate resource allocation for recruitment at

individual campuses, based on the competitive dynamics at each university. For the purpose of

this case study, we are solely focusing on campus-based recruitment for undergraduates, though

we have separate strategies for graduate students and professionals.

This year, we have a three-tier strategy for undergraduates, represented by 1 â€“ 3, where 1

represents the most resource investment. Last year, we used a two-tier strategy for

undergraduates, represented as 2 and 3, where 2 represents the most resource investment.

Our question is simple: Our question is simple: What are the optimal tiers for our recruiting

strategies? More? Fewer? Which schools should be in which tiers?

To support this analysis, you will find basic information about every applicant over the past two

years and about every university where we recruit.
